I'm Victor Martinez and I live in Bayamon, PR. I work as a software engineer at [ALQMY](http://alqmy.io) and collaborate with [Engine 4](http://engine-4.com). I started work as a software developer when I started college in 2013. I'm now finishing my degree in Computer Science at the Politechnic University of Puerto Rico in San Juan, PR. My first programming language was PHP and C. I then moved on to programming in mainly in JavaScript. Now a days I work in a mix of Python, JavaScript and Go.

I consider myself a decent software developer, mainly focused in systems architecture and business logic. 

- In 2013 I started college at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez studying Computer Engineering. I studied there for 3 years, then dropped out for while.

- In 2015 I got my first internship at [Optivon, Inc.](http://optivonpr.com) as a software engineer. I mainly developed back-end software using [Node](https://nodejs.org). Later that year I started work on a research proyect at the Univeristy of Puerto Rico Mayagüez building a bus tracking system for data analysis.

- In 2016 I started a summer internship at the [MITRE Corporation](https://mitre.org). A not-forprofit that operates FFRDCs for the United States Federal Government. I worked there as a data engineering intern.

- In 2017 I transfered to the Politechnic Unitersity of Puerto Rico in hopes of finishing my C.S degree in or before 2019. That same year I started ALQMY with some friends. I worked for a time with [Buena Vibra](http://buenavibra.com/) and later started collaborating with [Engine 4](http://engine-4.com) a coworking space in Bayamon, PR.
