I'm a Software Engineer working at [ALQMY](http://www.alqmy.io) and also a student at Politechnic University of Puerto Rico. I'm currently finishing my degree in computer science. I mainly architect and develop software and software ifrastructure. I'm also learning Marchine Learning and A.I.

I'm very passionate about technology, especially software. I often do freelance or contract work for other clients. If you want to see if I can help you with something, like building an app, making a server, etc. feel free to contact me via any of my social links.
