This post was inspired by a talk given by Jared Haight from Microsoft at [BSidesPR](http://bsidespr.org/2017/). Jared talked about giving back to the InfoSec community at a large, and he mentioned things to write about, including Blockchain. Specifically, he asked "WTF is Blockchain?" and said it that if you actually title it like that, he'd read it. So, this is my response.
