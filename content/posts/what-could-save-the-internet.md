With Net Neutrality being threatened again and communications giants wanting to control more and more of what happens on the internet in their favor what could we do as internet citizens to protect our freedoms on the internet?

Since 2009 with the creation of [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org) there has been a resurgence of P2P distributed networks that aim to provide more open access and greater freedoms to the end user. This I believe is key to saving the internet and saving our freedoms on it. Recently I came across [ipfs](https://ipfs.io) a project that aims to create a "peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol
to make the web faster, safer, and more open." One of their central reasons for this project is the fact that although the internet has been "been one of the great equalizers in human history and a real accelerator of innovation" an increase in "consolidation of control is a threat to that."
