description: A rant, out of anger...

The other day I got into a discussion quickly turned spitfire contest. At the end of our argument my opponent uttered the words "you're just a programmer" and "when you become [insert other expert profession here] then you can give an definitive statement." With those words hanging in the air they stormed off. Needless to say, I'm still very angry about that. No one is ever just a single thing and not being an expert in a profession or field doesn't mean you can't have definitive statements or opinions about subjects in those fields. I know I'm not an expert in everything, of course I know that... Yet that doesn't mean I can't say what I know and be sure of what I know in those areas. Hell, even as a programmer many non programmers have been more knowledgeable in something from my area than I have been.

We need to get rid of this erroneous notion that in order to have a definitive say in a subject you have to be an undisputed expert in it. That is wrong, it's hurtful, it puts people in boxes, and it's a useless idea to hold. People don't exists in boxes where beyond the things in those boxes they can never have a say in. It just doesn't work out that way.

This maybe rather "ranty" and it probably is. As I write this I'm quite angry and offended. What was being discussed did not bother me, but what was said about me did. I guess what I want to get out is that I felt boxed in and that somehow my statements where being invalidated. You shouldn't do that to a person.

This isn't the first time I've dealt with something similar, it's a kind of theme in my life I would say. Being boxed in by my peers for having opinions or statements in subject matters, being told "who are you to say that?" or "you're just x..." That kind of rhetoric is hurtful and it doesn't make your argument more or less valid nor does it make you right or wrong, it just makes you an asshole.

Think twice about the words you utter, they affect people more than you know. I'm quite fine, actually, I'm used to it. Others may not be so and this kind of language can seriously cause people a lot of pain. Though, if you've said things like that, I doubt you care a lot about how people feel about themselves and care more about how they feel about you and that only have to validated.
