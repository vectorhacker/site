So Amazon [recently announced](https://www.recode.net/2017/10/25/16538828/amazon-key-in-home-delivery-prime-camera-lock) a new program called [Amazon Key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Key). This program would let deliverymen enter the house of people who have purchased the program. I'm really uncomfortalbe with this idea. For one thing, I don't want Amazon, much less any other giant company, controlling entrance to my home. Second, this just feels like a whole new invasion of privacy.

This is just part of a much bigger problem. Sillicon Valley companies are becomming so arrogant and negligant, and they're giving me more and more reason to stop trusting them. Why would Amazon think that I would trust them with the security of my home? I say no.
