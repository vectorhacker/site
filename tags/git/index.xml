It fails the hook fails. This allows you to catch integration errors and get feedback quickly. This strategy works best with trunk-based development and ci/cd teams, because it helps avoid breaking the build and reduces dumb mistakes from even being pushed up to main.
At Coqui Health, we&amp;rsquo;ve implemented this strategy successfully and this is now the default way we work.</description></item></channel></rss>
