        <p>I remember the first time I knew I wanted to do something related to computers. I was in the sixth grade and our computer teacher tried and failed to show us how to build a webpage with HTML. At the end of the class none of us had a working webpage, but the very idea that I could build one on my own and that I didn&rsquo;t need anything special but a computer to do it intrigued me as a kid. Early on I knew I liked computers a lot. I spent most of my time as a child playing computer games, especially those games that involved some sort of planning or strategy like simulators or tycoons such as Roller Coaster Tycoon and SimCity. After our class had finished, I was still interested in the idea of making my own websites and even learn to make computers do what I wanted them to do, so I spent the summer before going to the 7th grade learning how to make websites. I got on to W3 schools and followed the tutorials and guides from the moment I woke up to the moment I went to bed. I had even started downloading books about. It was through that that I learned about programming in general and what it would mean for me if I learned it.</p>
