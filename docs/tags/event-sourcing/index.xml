      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve recently gone into doing CQRS with event sourcing along with DDD (Domain Driven Design) principles. I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing it in Go and want to share how I do it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To begin with, I&amp;rsquo;ve researched this topic thoroughly; I&amp;rsquo;ve probably watched and re-watched hundreds of videos and read many posts, articles, and books on it. I am by no means a cqrs/es expert, but I have gained some insight into how to do it. The first thing I want to put out there is that you don&amp;rsquo;t need a framework to do this. Ddd and cqrs/es are best done without a framework getting in the way and instead you should create a &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html&#34;&gt;Clean Architecture&lt;/a&gt; where the framework you choose later on becomes a sort of plugin into your application.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
