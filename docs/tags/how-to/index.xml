      <description>&lt;p&gt;You read the title, you&amp;rsquo;re probably thinking &amp;ldquo;that sounds like it&amp;rsquo;ll be a crappy idea&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;that sounds exactly like what I want!&amp;rdquo; For the first person, I hope to convince you that a computer science degree need not take 4 years nor be expensive. For the second, I hope to give you a roadmap to earn an accredited CS degree. But, before I start I want to preface this by saying that I am not advocating you go out to a degree mill and just buy a Diploma from a fake school, I&amp;rsquo;ll only be talking about legal, accredited, and reputable ways to get your degree in under 2 years, even less. I also know that it&amp;rsquo;s possible, because I essentially did it last year. So, without further ado, here&amp;rsquo;s how to get a bachelors degree in computer science fast and cheaply.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
