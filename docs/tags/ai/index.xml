      <description>&lt;p&gt;I align with Yann LeCun&amp;rsquo;s camp on this matter. I don&amp;rsquo;t believe that LLMs and machine learning alone will lead us to human-level intelligence. Current models have demonstrated only very limited reasoning capabilities within specific domains—essentially following and recombining similar patterns they&amp;rsquo;ve ingested during training.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you follow computer scientist and AI researcher Subbarao Kambhampati, a professor at the School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence at ASU, he proposes and demonstrates that language models and reasoning models cannot plan effectively even in domains as simple as organizing blocks in a virtual world, let alone in more complex domains.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Take a look at this search of jobs postings at OpenAI for December 25th, 2024. As of the time of this writing, over 150 results in all, 87 results for the term &amp;ldquo;Software Engineer.&amp;rdquo; This is a few days after the release of their latest frontier model, o3. This tells me that for the foreseeable future, Software Engineering jobs are safe, if not going to continue to be safe from full automation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
