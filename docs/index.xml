      <title>You&#39;re Just a Programmer...</title>

      <description>The other day I got into a discussion quickly turned spitfire contest. At the end of our argument my opponent uttered the words &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rsquo;re just a programmer&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;when you become [insert other expert profession here] then you can give an definitive statement.&amp;rdquo; With those words hanging in the air they stormed off. Needless to say, I&amp;rsquo;m still very angry about that. No one is ever just a single thing and not being an expert in a profession or field doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you can&amp;rsquo;t have definitive statements or opinions about subjects in those fields.</description>

      <description>I know I haven&amp;rsquo;t posted in a long time, but I finally felt I needed an update in my blog. I&amp;rsquo;ve recently updated some work on my own Go library for EventStore called goro. I made this for my own personal work and my job at ALQMY.
I used to use Go.GetEventStore as my prefered library for working with EventStore. It was nice, but I felt it was lacking in many features and was ultimitely very cumbersome to work with, especially when it comes to reading events in a streaming fashion.</description>

      <description>Hi guys, I&amp;rsquo;ve been silent mostly because of work. New things are happening and the company is growing. I&amp;rsquo;m working with new things related to Blockchain and I&amp;rsquo;m working on consulting more.</description>

      <title>WTF is Blockchain?</title>

      <description>This post was inspired by a talk given by Jared Haight from Microsoft at BSidesPR. Jared talked about giving back to the InfoSec community at a large, and he mentioned things to write about, including Blockchain. Specifically, he asked &amp;ldquo;WTF is Blockchain?&amp;rdquo; and said it that if you actually title it like that, he&amp;rsquo;d read it. So, this is my attempt at writing that description.
TLDR: Blockchain is an unchangeable series of blocks that each reference the previous&amp;rsquo; block&amp;rsquo;s contents via a hash of that content.</description>

      <title>Amazon Key</title>

      <description>So Amazon recently announced a new program called Amazon Key. This program would let deliverymen enter the house of people who have purchased the program. I&amp;rsquo;m really uncomfortable with this idea. For one thing, I don&amp;rsquo;t want Amazon, much less any other giant company, controlling entrance to my home. Second, this just feels like a whole new invasion of privacy.
This is just part of a much bigger problem. Silicon Valley companies are becoming so arrogant and negligent, and they&amp;rsquo;re giving me more and more reason to stop trusting them.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m hosting this blog using Github pages (because I&amp;rsquo;m cheap.) You can browser through the source code here. I&amp;rsquo;m using Hugo to generate the static site. Overall it&amp;rsquo;s pretty great.</description>

      <description>Background This December, the FCC will vote on wether to keep or reverse Title II of the Communications Act of 1934 in regards to ISPs. This decision will affect the way the internet works in the United States and if reversed, would give ISPs incentive to give preferential treatment of some data packets over others, among many other things that they could do. These rules are with the intent of creating a level playing field within the internet and keeping the internet free and open.</description>
