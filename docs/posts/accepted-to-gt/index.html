      <div class="post-content">
        <p>Back on May 31st, 2024, right as I submitted my last assignment for my capstone course, my last class on my BSCS at WGU, I applied for Georgia Tech’s OMSCS program. In August, days before my graduation ceremony, I heard back that I got accepted into the Spring 2025 cohort of Georgia Tech’s Online Masters of Science in Computer Science and this week I just got my gatech.edu email address.</p>
<p>I’m excited to be taking part in this amazing program, it’s really a dream come true. This will give me an opportunity to really focus in on areas of computer science I find most interesting. I plan on doing the Interactive Intelligence specialization. Now I know what you’re probably thinking (or not, I don’t personally know you and it’s rude to assume, but I can make a pretty good guess) “oh boy, just another one looking to get in on the AI hyper train.” Well, no… You see, for me AI and ML have always been an are of intrigue for me since my first freshman year back in 2013, during my first degree attempt and I want to learn about AI as a field in general because of a personal curiosity of not just AI itself, but computer science as a whole.</p>
<h2 id="why-georgia-tech">Why Georgia Tech?</h2>
<p>For me, besides Georgia Tech being one of my dream schools when I first wanted to go to college, there are several other factors for why I choose GT. These include a high ranking among computer science departments, program affordability, name recognition, and rigorous academic standards.</p>
<p>As of the time of this blog post, Georgia Tech ranks #7 in computer science and #5 in artificial intelligence among US colleges in the US News and World Report rankings, ranks #3 on <a href="https://csrankings.org">csrankings.org</a>, and #9 on niche.org. Suffice it to say it’s easily a top 5 to 10 school for computer science.</p>
<p>The program is easily affordable to me, costing less than $10k for the whole package. Not adjusting for any future inflation, it’ll cost around $7000 in 2.5 or 3 years for all 10 courses plus fees or around $700 per course. For a top 5 school masters program, this is a steal of a deal.</p>
<p>Of course, I don’t have to convince you that having gone to Georgia Tech is a big resume boost. I didn’t specifically choose them for that reason, but I cannot lie and say it didn’t factor in. Don’t get me wrong, <a href="https://wgu.edu">WGU</a> was a good school and I am forever grateful for them giving the opportunity to finish with a reputable degree, but having them on your resume is not a huge boost other than ticking the accredited degree box. Having gone and finished Georgia Tech would give me huge edge in the job market on top of my experience.</p>
<p>Finally Georgia Tech is well known for its high academic standards and rigorous academic programs. I do not expect this graduate program to be easy nor do I want it to be. I want a challenge not only for its sake, but to push me towards learning new things.</p>
<h2 id="excited-for-the-future">Excited For the Future</h2>
<p>I’m extremely excited for the future. I’ll be working hard towards my studies and my career. And that’s really all I could ever hope to do.</p>
<p>I’ll let you all know in a few years if I managed to complete the program and throughout the program I’ll keep you updated on what I’m doing and how I’m doing it.</p>
<p>See you on the other side!</p>
