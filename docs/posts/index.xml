      <description>So Amazon recently announced a new program called Amazon Key. This program would let deliverymen enter the house of people who have purchased the program. I&amp;rsquo;m really uncomfortalbe with this idea. For one thing, I don&amp;rsquo;t want Amazon, much less any other giant company, controlling entrance to my home. Second, this just feels like a whole new invasion of privacy.
This is just part of a much bigger problem. Sillicon Valley companies are becomming so arrogant and negligant, and they&amp;rsquo;re giving me more and more reason to stop trusting them.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m hosting this blog using Github pages (because I&amp;rsquo;m cheap.) You can browser through the source code here. I&amp;rsquo;m using Hugo to generate the static site. Overall it&amp;rsquo;s pretty great.</description>

      <description>Background This December, the FCC will vote on wether to keep or reverse Title II of the Communications Act of 1934 in regards to ISPs. This decision will affect the way the internet works in the United States and if reversed, would give ISPs incentive to give preferential treatment of some data packets over others, among many other things that they could do. These rules are with the intent of creating a level playing field within the internet and keeping the internet free and open.</description>
